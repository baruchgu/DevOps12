# Suggestions

### Project
- pic: usually when misc files are added to project, for the sake of UI/UX, on behalf of github, it is required to be called assets
- pic: I don;t mind to use technions logo on the project, yet recruter really like it when you come with your own branding, so creating your own logo/picture, that represents you it preferable. 
### README
- there are too many readme files and not all are clear what they represent. you need, either to combine all the readme info to one file, or each readme file needs to have a specific introduction, on what they represent.
